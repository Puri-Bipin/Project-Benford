# Project-Benford

This is a Python web application built using the Pyramid web framework that allows users to check if a given set of numerical data conforms to Benford's Law. Benford's Law, also known as the First-Digit Law, is a phenomenon in which the first digits of many sets of numerical data are not evenly distributed, but instead follow a logarithmic distribution. The law has been found to apply to a wide variety of data sets, from natural phenomena such as populations and sizes of geographical features to man-made data such as accounting figures and voting results.
